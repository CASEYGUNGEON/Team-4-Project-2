##Users
As a user you can:
* View public potlucks, even if the User is not logged in.
* Create a User Account if you are unregistered.
* Login to a User Account.

    * The owner is provided a link regardless of whether the potluck is public or private.


The User can:
* View public potlucks, even if not logged in
* Edit a Potluck Date/Time unless within an hour of an existing potluck if the User is the owner.
* Have the Ability to delete a potluck if the user is creator of said potluck.
* Create Items for potlucks, even if the user is not logged into an account/not the potluck creator.
